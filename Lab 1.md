Tool A Cursor use pygame and its code is highly short and highly mature, with smooth performance. A real quick set up, great interface and integration for the app.

B Copilot use turtle and the code is relatively low and long, and the game interface is wrong, the side bars are vertical instead of horizontal. Setting up Copilot has a lot of trouble, I reinstalled and go back to the website for answers multiple times and it is still showing me getting copilot ready loading as of now.
